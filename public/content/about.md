Hi, I'm Ritesh — a software developer with a passion for turning ideas into fast, scalable, and user-friendly digital experiences. I specialize in full-stack web development and have a strong foundation in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Python.

Over the past few years, I've built and contributed to a wide range of projects, from interactive dashboards and e-commerce platforms to real-time collaboration tools. My focus is on writing clean, maintainable code and building products that users genuinely enjoy using.

I believe that great software is built through collaboration, continuous learning, and a deep understanding of both code and people. I'm always eager to explore new technologies and take on challenges that push me to grow as a developer.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy sketching, exploring new coffee shops, and playing indie games.
